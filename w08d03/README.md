# W08D03 - End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### To Do
- [x] Jest vs Cypress
- [x] Install and Configure Cypress
- [x] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

### Comparison
* Jest
  * unit tests/integration tests
  * based on the command line
  * based around the idea of testing assertions

* Cypress
  * runs its own browser
  * when tests finish, our app is left in a fully functioning state
  * mostly used for integration and end-to-end testing
