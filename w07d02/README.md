### To Do
- [x] Recap: Components, Props, and State
- [x] Immutable Update Patterns
- [x] Benefits of Immutability
- [x] Immutable Data Patterns with Arrays and Objects

### Immutable
* unchanging, cannot be changed
* does not come by default

```js
const arr = [1];
arr = [2]; // error
arr.push(2);
```


HTTP Methods
* PUT => updating the entire resource

* The data structures are easier to test and reason about
* Removes side effects
* Makes it possible to compare current version to previous version
